<h1 style="color:black;">The Mermaid and the Sea of Plastic - Jessica Prakash</h1>

<p style="color:black;">My digital painting tells the story of a mermaid who lost her sea home due to ocean pollution. This piece connects with my 
own personal experiences with fighting depression. The mermaidâ€™s pose and destroyed habitat connect with feelings of sadness and loss of hope. Her ocean 
home destroyed by plastic pollution symbolizes hardships in life that cause people to feel defeated and want to give up. The night sky lit up with the moon and 
stars demonstrate how even though the mermaid is going through a dark time, there is still hope and this is not the end for her. The stars show that no matter how 
dark times are, there is always still hope that things can get better. The symbolism of the mermaid feeling trapped in a place with plastic pollution connects with the 
way difficulties in my life have made me feel trapped and depressed. Even though depression has made me feel like I was in darkness and had no hope, I would always 
eventually think about how everything will be ok in the end and that giving up is not ok. These thoughts of hope and positivity are like the stars that light up a 
dark sky, similarly to the way the stars light up the night sky above the mermaid.
